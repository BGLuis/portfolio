I vividly remember the first time I had access to a PC with Windows 98; it was a box full of mysteries and endless possibilities. I spent hours exploring Paint, organizing files into folders that led nowhere, and mainly trying to understand how that machine could create entire worlds inside a monitor. It was this childlike curiosity, this desire to unravel the 'magic' behind the screen, that planted the seed of my passion and guided me to the career I have today. That initial fascination never left me; it just evolved."
